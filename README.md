## Overseer

Overseer is a tool for starting, monitoring and managing long lived processes (jobs).
Overseer can set resource limits on jobs, for example limit CPU time, memory, prohibit spawning other children etc.

Job can specify websocket endpoints where command stdout and stderr can be streamed.

Everything in this repo is experimental.
